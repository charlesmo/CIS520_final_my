function K = kernel_intersection(X, X2)
% Evaluates the Histogram Intersection Kernel
%
% Usage:
%
%    K = KERNEL_INTERSECTION(X, X2)
%
% For a N x D matrix X and a M x D matrix X2, computes a M x N kernel
% matrix K where K(i,j) = k(X(i,:), X2(j,:)) and k is the histogram
% intersection kernel.

n = size(X,1);
m = size(X2,1);
K = zeros(m, n);

% HINT: Transpose the sparse data matrix X, so that you can operate over columns. Sparse
% column operations in matlab are MUCH faster than row operations.

% YOUR CODE GOES HERE.
X2 = X2';
X = X';

for i = 1:m
    A = repmat(X2(:,i),1,n);
    K(i,:) = 0.5 * sum(A+X-abs(A-X));
